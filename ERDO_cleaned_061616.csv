To CLA 6/16/16: ""I was quite surprised to see the porcupine, as I had no idea there were any in Sonoma County, or anywhere in the Bay Area. I was conducting a breeding bird atlas survey when I came across it. At first, I didn't know what it was. In fact, it looked like a strange plant, because I was looking at the fanned-out spines. Once I realized what it was, I backed off, and it slowly retracted the spines (very cool) and finished chewing on something in its mouth, while slowly walking away. I was walking on a fire road in the Austin Creek State Recreation Area, just north of Armstrong Woods State Reserve near Guerneville.
