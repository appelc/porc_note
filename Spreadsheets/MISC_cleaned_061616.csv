It immediately assumed its defense posture, and did not move until I backed off to about 20 feet. Then it relaxed the quills and resumed chewing on something already in its mouth. I have a video on YouTube also: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2RNzo3htE "" 
To CLA 6/16/16: ""I was quite surprised to see the porcupine, as I had no idea there were any in Sonoma County, or anywhere in the Bay Area. I was conducting a breeding bird atlas survey when I came across it. At first, I didn't know what it was. In fact, it looked like a strange plant, because I was looking at the fanned-out spines. Once I realized what it was, I backed off, and it slowly retracted the spines (very cool) and finished chewing on something in its mouth, while slowly walking away. I was walking on a fire road in the Austin Creek State Recreation Area, just north of Armstrong Woods State Reserve near Guerneville. The coordinates were approximately Lat 38.5639519262, Lon -123.0538272858. Sighting was on May 9, 2011 at about 2:00 pm.
